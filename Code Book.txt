This file contains descriptions of the original variables taken from the original download
and then expands upon those original definitions where appropriate to describe the 
additions and or modifications made along the way to compose the tidy data set.

From the beginning I will mention that the file created is in the long form demonstrated
in the FAQ section.

Original Files:
	activity_labels.txt
	features.txt
	features_info.txt
	README.txt
	Data files:
		X_test.text, x_train.txt, y_test.txt, y_train.txt.
		These files contain the values of all of the measures made by the device.

Original Features Information from the features.txt file. 

Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 
3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to 
denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a 
median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 
20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body 
and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another 
low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to 
obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of 
these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm 
(tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing 
fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, 
fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Final Data Set Variable descriptions  

Activities:
	Source: activity_lables.txt
	1 WALKING
	2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
	3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
	4 SITTING
	5 STANDING
	6 LAYING
Simple description of the subjects activities and the numeric codes. It is this file that
serves as the source to re-code the y test and train data into a more descriptive variable.
These activities are exactly the same in all datasets described in the flow of the 
creation of the final data file.

Subjects:
	Source: subject_test.txt and subject_train.txt
	Coded as numbers 1-30.
	The variable column is labeled as Subject
	
These are also kept the same throughout the entire data set and all datasets created
throughout the process.

Training_Labels:
The recoding of this variable is basically as above. The numeric and character strings
were matched as a more descriptive variable.

	1 = WALKING
	2 = WALKING_UPSTAIRS
	3 = WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
	4 = SITTING
	5 = STANDING
	6 = LAYING
	
Measurement Variables and Measure Column:
The original x datasets are combined with both the subject data set and the y data sets.
The datasets are ultimately with each other to form a larger dataset. 10,299 rows. 
The column labels are added only after the datasets are combined and the mean and sd 
columns are selected. 
As an example of how the columns were named I will demonstrate this example for the 
entire set:

From features.txt | Column Label
-----------------------------------
tBodyAcc-mean()-X | mean_tbodyacc_x

Using the gather() command, the 82 columns I selected, are condensed into a single 
identifier column. This Column is labeled Measure.

Value:
This column is not seen in the final tidy data set but is placed in the penultimate data 
set to hold the value of what was for me 10,299 rows * 82 Measures which totaled
844,518 rows.

Mean:
This column holds the value of the mean for each measure for each subject and activity.
This is created using the summarize function after grouping the penultimate data set 
on the first three columns, Subject, Training_Labels and Measure.
