This file contains descriptions of the original variables taken from the original download
and then expands upon those original definitions where appropriate to describe the 
additions and or modifications made along the way to compose the tidy data set.

From the beginning I will mention that the file created is in the long form demonstrated
in the FAQ section.

Original Files:
	activity_labels.txt
	features.txt
	features_info.txt
	README.txt
	Data files:
		X_test.text, x_train.txt, y_test.txt, y_train.txt.
		These files contain the values of all of the measures made by the device.

Simple description of the subjects activities and the numeric codes. It is this file that
serves as the source to re-code the y test and train data into a more descriptive variable.
These activities are exactly the same in all datasets described in the flow of the 
creation of the final data file.

Subjects:
	Source: subject_test.txt and subject_train.txt
	Coded as numbers 1-30.
These are also kept the same throughout the entire data set
